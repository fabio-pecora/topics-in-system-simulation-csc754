This repository is dedicated to exploring the theories and applications of computer modeling and simulation. I cover basic concepts of systems modeling, delve into modeling elements, simulation protocols, and their relationships. The modeling and simulation techniques are demonstrated through examples using DEVSJAVA, a Java-based implementation of the systematic and generic DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) approach to modeling and simulation.

Possible application domains include communication, manufacturing, social/biological systems, and business. I also touch on selected advanced concepts and practices in this field.
