        <b>Agent Modeling and Simulation: </b> <br> </br>
Agent modeling and simulation is an area of research that helps us understand how autonomous agents, whether theyâ€™re people, organizations, or artificial entities, interact within complex systems. By simulating individual agents with their own decision-making processes, behaviors, and learning mechanisms, we can analyze how these interactions shape larger patterns and outcomes. This approach is widely used in artificial intelligence, economics, robotics, healthcare, and even social sciences to model everything from traffic systems to financial markets. With advancements in machine learning, multi-agent systems, and high-performance computing, simulations today are more detailed and dynamic than ever. Researchers use agent-based modeling to study real-world problems like epidemic outbreaks, supply chain disruptions, and smart city planning. As these techniques evolve, they continue to offer new insights into decision-making, optimization, and predictive analysis across different industries. For this survey, weâ€™ll explore key foundational research, recent innovations, and major applications in agent modeling and simulation. By reviewing and categorizing important papers, we hope to provide a clear picture of where this field stands today and where itâ€™s headed in the future.
