        <br>
          Agent modeling and simulation is an area of research that helps us understand how autonomous agents, whether they‚Äôre people, organizations, or artificial entities, interact within complex systems. By simulating individual agents with their own decision-making processes, behaviors, and learning mechanisms, we can analyze how these interactions shape larger patterns and outcomes. This approach is widely used in artificial intelligence, economics, robotics, healthcare, and even social sciences to model everything from traffic systems to financial markets. With advancements in machine learning, multi-agent systems, and high-performance computing, simulations today are more detailed and dynamic than ever. Researchers use agent-based modeling to study real-world problems like epidemic outbreaks, supply chain disruptions, and smart city planning. As these techniques evolve, they continue to offer new insights into decision-making, optimization, and predictive analysis across different industries. For this survey, we‚Äôll explore key foundational research, recent innovations, and major applications in agent modeling and simulation. By reviewing and categorizing important papers, we hope to provide a clear picture of where this field stands today and where it‚Äôs headed in the future.

              <div class="comment-content"> This paper gives an overview of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS), making it a strong starting point for both new and experienced researchers in the field. The authors introduce ABMS through a series of real-world scenarios, ranging from evacuating airports to modeling ancient civilizations, which helps ground the concepts in practical relevance. They clearly define the core components of any agent-based model: autonomous agents, interactions among agents, and the simulated environment. One of the strengths of the paper is how it contrasts ABMS with traditional modeling approaches, explaining why bottom-up modeling is better suited to capturing emergent behaviors and heterogeneity in complex systems. The discussion of tools like NetLogo, Repast, SeSAm, and MASON is particularly helpful for understanding the technical options available and how they align with different modeling needs. The paper also doesn‚Äôt shy away from the challenges of ABMS, such as difficulties in validation, calibration, and reproducibility, issues that are especially relevant when modeling human behavior or large-scale systems. It introduces important methodological concerns like ‚Äúknife-edge‚Äù parameters and the brittleness of outcomes, and even touches on efforts to improve standardization through protocols like ODD. The traffic simulation examples and social science applications provide useful illustrations of how ABMS works in practice, and they also highlight the flexibility of the approach.

              <div class="comment-content">This paper presents agent-based modeling (ABM) as a conceptually rich and versatile approach for simulating human systems, with a strong emphasis on real-world business and organizational applications. Bonabeau provides a comprehensive overview of ABM‚Äôs strengths by grounding the discussion in concrete domains‚Äîflow, market, organizational, and diffusion simulations‚Äîeach illustrated with detailed examples that reflect the generative power of bottom-up modeling. One of the paper‚Äôs key contributions lies in articulating the three major advantages of ABM: its capacity to capture emergent phenomena, its natural alignment with behavioral systems, and its inherent modeling flexibility. By contrasting ABM with aggregate and equation-based approaches, Bonabeau highlights how ABM accommodates complex individual behaviors, heterogeneous agents, and dynamic network structures that traditional methods tend to oversimplify or overlook. The paper also offers an insightful discussion on practical business cases‚Äîfrom crowd dynamics in fire evacuations to market behavior in NASDAQ and customer flow in theme parks‚Äîdemonstrating the method‚Äôs explanatory power and practical utility. Importantly, the article does not ignore the limitations of ABM, such as computational intensity and the challenges of modeling human cognition and irrationality, but rather addresses them thoughtfully, reinforcing that while ABM is not always quantitatively precise, it remains often the only viable option for modeling complex adaptive systems. Overall, the paper serves as a persuasive argument for adopting ABM not just as a simulation method but as a mindset that shifts the focus from aggregate assumptions to the emergent dynamics of individual-level behavior.</div>

              <div class="comment-content">This paper provides a focused and timely overview of how agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has been applied within the construction domain, bridging a gap between traditional modeling approaches and the need to simulate human-centric, decentralized decision-making in construction processes. It emphasizes the limitations of conventional tools in capturing the complexity, uncertainty, and dynamic nature of construction environments, where multiple stakeholders interact over time with evolving goals and incomplete information. By categorizing ABMS applications into areas like resource allocation, labor dynamics, safety behavior, and project scheduling, the authors effectively show the versatility of the approach and its ability to model both physical operations and social interactions. The paper also offers a useful synthesis of recent case studies, highlighting how ABMS can account for behavioral variability and emergent system-level outcomes. Particularly valuable is the discussion on the need for model validation, stakeholder engagement, and integration with Building Information Modeling (BIM), which strengthens the practical relevance of ABMS in construction research and industry applications. </div>

              <div class="comment-content">This paper gives a useful and clear overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) and agent-based modeling (ABM) have been used together in recent research, using a detailed bibliometric analysis to show trends over time. The authors carefully collected 180 papers from the Web of Science and explained their selection steps clearly, which helps make their process transparent and trustworthy. One of the strongest points of the paper is how it shows the growing interest in combining AI and ABM, especially after 2006, with a clear peak in publications during 2021 and 2022. This rise suggests that researchers are increasingly using AI tools like machine learning to improve how agent-based models are built, trained, and applied in real-world problems. The paper also explores which authors, countries, and journals have contributed the most, and uses visual tools like graphs and maps to show how these contributions are connected. Another useful part of the paper is the analysis of keywords, which helps readers understand the main topics in the field, such as learning, prediction, behavior, and system design. The authors explain that AI helps ABM by making it easier to simulate how individuals behave and adapt over time, which is especially useful when modeling complex systems like traffic, health, or the environment. They also point out that while the combination of AI and ABM has many advantages, there are still some challenges, such as keeping up with fast changes in technology and deciding how to organize research that comes from many different fields.</div>

              <div class="comment-content">This paper presents a valuable contribution to disaster risk management (DRM) research by developing an agent-based model (ABM) that integrates dynamic human behavior into the evaluation of DRM measures. The authors use a real-world case study‚Äîthe 2010 debris flow disaster in Longchi, China‚Äîto simulate how individual decisions, perceptions, and reactions can shape the effectiveness of disaster responses. This approach marks a clear improvement over traditional models, which often overlook human variability and social dynamics. By representing residents as autonomous agents with their own psychological, physical, and social attributes, the model is able to replicate evacuation decisions based on factors such as risk perception, disaster knowledge, and past experience. One of the most important findings of the study is the demonstrated effectiveness of early warning systems (EWS), which, when trusted by the public, can reduce casualties by up to 33%. However, the paper also shows that the credibility of EWS is a critical factor‚Äîwhen residents do not trust the warnings, the system‚Äôs effectiveness is significantly reduced. This highlights a central insight: technological solutions must be paired with strong communication strategies and community engagement in order to work effectively. Moreover, the model shows that combining EWS with additional DRM tools such as nearby disaster shelters and incentive plans can lead to further reductions in risk. For example, shelters that are perceived as safe and accessible can increase residents‚Äô willingness to evacuate, while even small incentives can nudge people toward taking protective actions. However, the paper also offers a cautionary message‚Äîif shelters are too far or poorly equipped, or if incentives are not well designed, these measures can backfire and even reduce the overall effectiveness of EWS. The use of real geographic and demographic data, along with interviews and surveys from Longchi residents, makes the simulation particularly grounded and realistic. This allows the authors to explore a variety of scenarios and test how different factors influence outcomes. Importantly, the paper demonstrates how ABM can serve not only as a theoretical tool but as a practical decision-support system for local governments. By simulating disaster responses under different configurations of DRM measures, stakeholders can identify strategies that are both cost-effective and sensitive to community needs. </div>

              <div class="comment-content">This literature review offers an examination of the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to analyze pedestrian dynamics within the built environment. The authors present a well-organized synthesis of current research, identifying key developments, applications, and challenges associated with ABM in this field. By exploring how ABM compares to traditional modeling techniques such as macroscopic, microscopic, and mesoscopic models, the paper effectively highlights the unique value of ABM in capturing the complex, emergent behavior of individuals interacting with their surroundings. This is particularly important in urban settings, where human movement patterns are shaped by a wide range of factors, including spatial design, environmental cues, and individual decision-making. A notable strength of the paper is its focus on bridging theory and practice. The authors not only discuss the conceptual foundations of ABM but also provide concrete examples of its implementation in real-world contexts such as transportation hubs, evacuation scenarios, and public space design. This practical orientation makes the review especially useful for urban planners and designers who aim to integrate data-driven, behaviorally-informed models into their projects. Additionally, the review‚Äôs structured methodology, including its clear research questions, selection criteria, and synthesis of results, adds rigor and transparency to the findings. The paper also addresses the limitations of ABM, including challenges related to data availability, model calibration, and computational demands. Rather than presenting these issues as barriers, the authors offer constructive suggestions for future research. </div>

              <div class="comment-content">This paper presents an impressive and well-integrated simulation framework that captures the spread of COVID-19 through realistic, person-level mobility patterns. By linking detailed mobility trajectories derived from mobile phone data with an agent-based epidemiological model and a disease progression framework, the authors offer a nuanced understanding of how everyday activities contribute to the reproduction number (R) over time. One of the key strengths of the study lies in its ability to quantify the individual and combined effects of interventions‚Äîsuch as school closures, mask mandates, changes in mobility behavior, and indoor vs. outdoor activities‚Äîon the spread of the virus in Berlin. Unlike traditional compartmental models that generalize population behaviors, this simulation directly reflects changes in human movement, contact environments, and time-dependent exposure risk. The model's calibration using real hospital data, along with its successful predictions of infection waves, particularly in the fall of 2020, demonstrate its strong empirical grounding. Additionally, the paper makes an important conceptual contribution by showing that changes to R are more reliably modeled as additive effects rather than proportional reductions, especially in complex urban environments. The inclusion of temperature-dependent behavior changes, such as the shift from outdoor to indoor leisure, adds valuable realism and explains seasonal infection trends</div>

              <div class="comment-content">This paper introduces the Golden Region (GR) search, a new method for solving simulation optimization problems where the objective function is expensive or difficult to evaluate directly. The method is built on the idea of dividing the feasible region into smaller sub-regions and using a smart strategy to decide which region to search next. In each step, GR considers how much a region has been explored (space score), how good the results in that region have been so far (quality score), and predictions from a trained model (metamodel score). These scores help the algorithm focus its search where the best results are likely to be found, balancing exploration of new areas and refinement of promising ones.

                The paper also explains how the method adapts over time by updating the importance of the three criteria based on their past success. The authors show that the GR method fits within a larger class of algorithms that are proven to converge to the global optimum under certain conditions. They test GR on benchmark problems and compare it to other well-known methods like Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. The results suggest that GR is efficient and performs well, even without heavy parameter tuning. </div>

                  <div class="comment-content">This paper offers a review of agent-based modeling (ABM) in public health, effectively showcasing its growing relevance for studying complex health issues. The authors illustrate how ABMs go beyond traditional models by capturing how individual behaviors, social networks, and environmental factors interact to shape population health outcomes. By covering both communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as behaviors like smoking and physical activity, the paper demonstrates the wide applicability of ABMs across domains. Importantly, it highlights the strengths of ABMs in uncovering causal mechanisms and running virtual policy experiments that would be difficult or impossible to carry out in real life. At the same time, the authors are careful to discuss the limitations of these models, such as difficulties in validation, parameter uncertainty, and balancing simplicity with realism. Their recommendations for improving methodology, especially around model calibration, validation, and integration with causal inference methods, are timely and necessary for advancing the field. The call to broaden the focus of ABMs to include comorbidities, life course processes, and multi-level risk factors is especially valuable for addressing real-world public health problems.

                <div class="comment-content">This paper introduces SafeMAP, a modular and risk-aware multi-agent planning framework that integrates dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) into mission planning for autonomous systems, with particular relevance to space exploration scenarios. By leveraging a Markovian Cell-to-Cell Mapping Technique (CCMT), the framework allows for simultaneous monitoring of system health, decision-making under uncertainty, and coordinated multi-agent planning. The authors provide a compelling case for the need for such a framework in future autonomous missions, particularly those involving small, distributed rover teams operating in uncertain environments like the lunar surface. Through a case study involving four rovers tasked with exploring a discretized grid map, the paper demonstrates how SafeMAP generates explainable mission plans that balance reward and risk over time. A key contribution lies in the framework‚Äôs ability to incorporate component-level health data into planning, thus bridging the gap between risk modeling and operational decision-making.</div>
